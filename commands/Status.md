T he command 'git status` is extremly helpfulwhen it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

Using `git status` will show you to pushed/pulled, etc. it is exactly what it sound like, a status check.

It's a command that is safe to use at any time. If you want to see what it is going on it's good to use git status inbetween commands untill you get to know the flow better.

```
git add .
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status
