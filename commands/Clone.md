# git clone

Cloning a repository is the art of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history

It will be also associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull ubdated from the original repository.

It can be done by the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clonehttps.//github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
